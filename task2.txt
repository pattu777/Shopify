I don't have much experience with either Ruby or Java Script. But I found the following errors/warnings in the scripts.

Improvements to JavaScript Code:
================================
1. Improper use of spaces between operators and variable names.
Ex -
* In line 6, there should be a space between 'x' and '='.
* In line 8, there should be only one space between '=' and 'order_object.price'.

2. In most of the comparisons, '===' should be used instead of '=='.
Ex -
* In line 5: order_object.price_level === "free"
* In line 7: order_object.price_level === "discount"

3. In line 21, 'order' is used instead of the correct variable name 'order_object'.

4. In line 32, 'html' variable is undefined.

5. In line 33, 'html' variable is used before it's defined.

6. Different indentations are applied in different lines.


Improvements to Ruby Code:
==========================
The constructor function in "TODO" class is not properly initialized. It should be modified as shown below.

##################

def initialize(file_name)
    @file_name = file_name      ## Initialize with a file name in local directory
    @items = []
  end
